# dyomproject

Project Repository for DYC1401.

This project aims to explore the DeepFM model based on the paper,
[Huifeng Guo and Ruiming Tang and Yunming Ye and Zhenguo Li and Xiuqiang He (2017).<br> DeepFM: A Factorization-Machine based Neural Network for CTR Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04247v1)

We also aim to find ways to improve the model.

# Potential Features
1. Implement Hash Encoding.
2. Implement pooling layers in DeepFM model as mentioned by the authors of the paper.

# Installation
Install DeepCTR-Torch: `pip install -U deepctr-torch`

# Credits:
This project has been built using the following packages:
1. [DeepCTR-Torch](https://github.com/shenweichen/DeepCTR-Torch)
    * Sample data from the repository has been used for testing as well.
